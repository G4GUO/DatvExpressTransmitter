Run the install program 
If you already have Express server installed on your machine there will be nothing further to do.
If not you will have to run Zadig to install the USB drivers.
Instructions for using Zadig can be found on the DATV-Express Website.
The program is fairly easy to use
After changing a parameter hit OK 
Then go to the file menu and click on save configuration.
Then go to the file menu and click on restart.
The program should then be ready to use the new parameters.

If you are only changing the frequency or level then there is no reason to restart the program.

At both high and low symbol rates the program does not correctly estimate the available
bit rate and it maybe necessary to go into a file called datvexpress.txt and adjusting the
VBITRATE twiddle factor. It simply multiplies it's estimate by the twiddle factor

When selecting a Video capture device, make sure you select a format.
Only analogue formats can be used YUV etc. I have included all the formats for debugging.

This program is very CPU intensive all the video and audio compression is done in software.

This is a very early Beta so I would appreciate any feedback good or bad.
If possible pleae use the BATC forum or DATV-Express yahoo group so information can 
be shared with others. If you are shy you can email me. I will then probably anonymise
the comment and then post it along with a response if I believe it would help others.

I am expecting you to break it!
